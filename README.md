# Long-Term Goals

1. Baseline: Make it at least comparable to the YT Comment Search Extension in terms of functionality and UI
2. Integrate GPT-4 or some other AI model to conduct sentiment analysis for whatever the user wants.
3. Possibly use langchain to give AI model access tools to search web, make visual graphs, etc. (maybe even agents? we'll see)

## Immediate stuff to do

1. Cache comments so that way it only loads comments once, and not every search.
2. Add the likes and dislikes counter.
3. Increase the top and bottom margins inbetween comments.
4. Add something to show reply thread for each filtered comment
5. Allow search to search not just top level comments, but also the replies.
6. Make profile image size constant. (Seems to change between normal and small, which fucks up the margins inebtween the image and the rest of the comment elements).
