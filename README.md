# Goals

1. Baseline: Make it at least comparable to the YT Comment Search Extension in terms of functionality and UI
2. Integrate GPT-4 or some other AI model to conduct sentiment analysis for whatever the user wants.
3. Possibly use langchain to give AI model access tools to search web, make visual graphs, etc.
